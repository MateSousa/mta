# mta

The `mta` cli will export Flux components to Argo CD consumable
CRs. This can be used in order to help migrating from Flux to Argo
CD. This is in the "proof of concept" phase and I make no guarantees

Currently working:

- [*] Migrate Kustomizations
- [ ] Migrate HelmReleases
- [ ] Auto Scan/Migrate
- [ ] Uninstall Flux

# Installation

TBD

# Quickstarts

Quickstarts to test the functionality after downloading the CLI

* [Kustomizations](#)
